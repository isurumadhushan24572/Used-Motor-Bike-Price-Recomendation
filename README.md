# Predicting the Price of Used Honda Dio Bikes in Sri Lanka

## Introduction

Sri Lanka has a popular vehicle selling website called Riyasewana. In this project, we aim to predict the price of used Honda Dio bikes in Sri Lanka using various features like brand, price, mileage, and year. The data for this project was obtained through web scraping from the reputed vehicle reselling site, Riyasewana.

**Being able to accurately predict the market value of used Honda Dio bikes can benefit both buyers and sellers.**

Many individuals are interested in the used Honda Dio motorbike market at some point in their lives, whether they want to sell their bike or buy a used one. It's crucial to avoid overpaying or selling for less than the market value. Our project addresses this need by providing accurate price predictions.
